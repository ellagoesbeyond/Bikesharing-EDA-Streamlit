  """ **Main goals**
As part of the team of the hired consultancy firm, your work is to build an interactive, insightful and complete report about the bike-sharing service in the city for the head of transportation services of the local government. As part of the requirements, there are two big points:
- The customer wants a deep analysis of the bike-sharing service. He wants to know how the citizens are using the service in order to know if some changes must be made to optimize costs or provide a better service.
- The customer also wants a predictive model able to predict the total number of bicycle users on an hourly basis. They believe this will help them in the optimization of bike provisioning and will optimize the costs incurred from the outsourcing transportation company.

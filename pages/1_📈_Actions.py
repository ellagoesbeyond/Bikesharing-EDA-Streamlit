    1. **Peak Hour Availability**: 
        - Increase bike availability during peak hours for `registered users`.
        - Increase bike availability during peak hours for `casual users`.
    2. **Provisioning**: 
        - Ensure higher bike availability during peak times in the commute times (early mornings and evenings) to attract more `casual users`.
    3. **Promotional Offers**: 
        - Introduce promotional offers for `casual users`during high-demand seasons (e.g. workingdays, early morning & evening hours, winter etc.)
        - Offer discounts for `registered users` during low-demand seasons (e.g. weekends,noon hours, winter, holiday season etc.)
    4. **Bike Maintenance**: 
        - Intensify maintenance checks to ensure optimal bike conditions.
    5. **Weather Preparedness**: 
        - Ensure that the bike supply meets the expected weather-based demand. 
        - You can use the weather forecast to predict demand and use historical data with our Machine Learning model to predict supply.

    # Business Insights on Bike Usage Patterns

    ## User Patterns

    ### Casual User Pattern: "Leisure Users"
    - **Primary Usage**: During weekends and good weather.
    - **Demand Peak**: Around noon.

    ### Registered User Pattern: "Get to Work Users"
    - **Primary Usage**: During weekdays, less sensitive to weather.
    - **Demand Peak**: Morning and afternoon (start/end of working day).
    - **Note**: When the weather worsens, both casual and registered bike users significantly reduce their usage. However, it's observed that in conditions of heavy precipitation, those who continue to use bikes are more likely to be registered users.
    ----------------------
    ## Demand Overview
    - Over a two-year period, **~80%** of daily demand comes from registered users.
    - Year-over-Year (YoY) demand increase is higher for registered users compared to casual users.
    ----------------------
    ## Strategic Advantages

    1. **Boost Customer Satisfaction**: Anticipating demand peaks to adjust bike supply, enhancing satisfaction and loyalty.
    2. **Operational Costs**: Optimizing bike supply to match demand, reducing excess supply costs.
    3. **Bike Availability**: Predicting demand fluctuations to schedule optimal times for bike redistribution and maintenance.
    4. **Demand Boosting**: Offering discounts during low demand periods (nights, cold weather) to attract price-sensitive customers.
    5. **Alternative Revenue Streams**: Renting out excess bikes in low demand periods (winter, night) to delivery services.
    -----------------------
    ## Considerations Beyond Current Analysis

    - **Bike Location**: Lack of location data could lead to unavailability in certain city regions, affecting revenue.
    - **Station Capacity**: Absence of station capacity data might deter potential users due to parking issues.
    - **District Analysis**: Bike location data could identify districts with high or low bike supply.
    - **Travel Distance**: Information on travel distances could reveal more detailed usage patterns and preferences, like the need for E-bikes for longer trips.
